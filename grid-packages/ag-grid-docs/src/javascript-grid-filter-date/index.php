<h1>Date Filter</h1>

<p class="lead">
    Date filters allow you to filter date data.
    The <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-provided/">Provided Filters</a> and
    <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-provided-simple/">Simple Filters</a> pages explain the parts of the
    date filter that are the same as the other provided filters. This page builds on that and explains some
    details that are specific to the date filter.
</p>

<h2>Date Filter Parameters</h2>

<p>
    Date Filters are configured though the <code>filterParams</code> attribute of the column definition. All of the
    parameters from Provided Filters are available:
</p>

<?= createDocumentationFromFile('../javascript-grid-filter-provided/providedFilters.json', 'filterParams'); ?>

<p>
    In addition, the following parameters are also available:
</p>

<?= createDocumentationFromFile('../javascript-grid-filter-provided-simple/simpleFilters.json', 'filterParams', ['Date']); ?>

<h2>Date Selection Component</h2>

<p>
    By default the grid will use the browser-provided date picker for Chrome and Firefox (as we think it's nice), but for all
    other browsers it will provide a simple text field. To override this and provide a custom date picker,
    see <a href="../javascript-grid-date-component/">Date Component</a>.
</p>

<h2>Date Filter Comparator</h2>

<p>
    Dates can be represented in your data in many ways e.g. as a JavaScript <code>Date</code> object, as a string in
    a particular format such as <code>'26-MAR-2020'</code>, or something else. How you represent dates will be particular to your application.
</p>

<p>
    By default, the date filter assumes you are using JavaScript <code>Date</code> objects. If this is the case, the
    date filter will work out of the box. However, if your date is in any other format you will have to provide
    your own <code>comparator</code> to perform the date comparisons.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>comparator</code> function takes two parameters. The first parameter is a
    JavaScript <code>Date</code> object for the selected date in the filter (with the time set to midnight). The second
    parameter is the current value of the cell in the row being evaluated. The function must return:
</p>

<ul class="content">
    <li>Any number < 0 if the cell value is less than the filter date</li>
    <li>0 if the dates are the same</li>
    <li>Any number > 0 if the cell value is greater than the filter date</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This pattern is intended to be similar to the JavaScript <code>compareTo(a, b)</code> function.
</p>

<p>
    Below is an example of using a date filter with a comparator.
</p>

<?= createSnippet(<<<SNIPPET
colDef = {
    ...
    // specify we want to use the date filter
    filter: 'agDateColumnFilter',

    // add extra parameters for the date filter
    filterParams: {
        // provide comparator function
        comparator: function(filterLocalDateAtMidnight, cellValue) {
            var dateAsString = cellValue;

            if (dateAsString == null) {
                return 0;
            }

            // In the example application, dates are stored as dd/mm/yyyy
            // We create a Date object for comparison against the filter date
            var dateParts = dateAsString.split('/');
            var day = Number(dateParts[2]);
            var month = Number(dateParts[1]) - 1;
            var year = Number(dateParts[0]);
            var cellDate = new Date(year, month, day);

            // Now that both parameters are Date objects, we can compare
            if (cellDate < filterLocalDateAtMidnight) {
                return -1;
            } else if (cellDate > filterLocalDateAtMidnight) {
                return 1;
            } else {
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
SNIPPET
) ?>

<p>
    Once the date comparator callback is provided, then the Date Filter is able to perform all the
    comparison operations it needs, e.g. 'Less Than', 'Greater Than' and 'Equals'.
</p>

<h2>Date Model vs Comparison Types</h2>

<p>
    It should be noted that the Date Filter Model represents the Date as a string in format <code>'YYYY-DD-MM'</code>,
    however when doing comparisons the date is provided as a JavaScript <code>Date</code> object as that's what date
    pickers typically work with. The model uses string representation to make it easier to save and avoid any timezone
    issues.
